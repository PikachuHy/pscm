An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone
The rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
Oh yeah
And all my love
We're holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
Hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again my love
Over seas from coast to coast
Find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love
I tried to read
I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop
To keep myself from thinking
Oh no
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
Oh yeah
And all my love
We're holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
Hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Over seas from coast to coast
Find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again
To hold you in my arms
To promise you my love
To tell you from my heart
You're all I'm thinking of
And reaching for the love that seems so far
So so I say a little prayer
Hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Over seas from coast to coast
Find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love
See you in a prayer
Dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again
Over seas from coast to coast
Find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love
